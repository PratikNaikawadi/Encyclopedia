            <h4>Clasification Of Trees:</h4>
            <p>There are many ways you can have varieties of trees.</p>

                data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-title="Trees based on leaves">1. Based on the leaves:</a></b></h4>
            <p>There are two subcategories when you identify trees based on leaves, and they are Deciduous and Evergreens.</p>
            <h4><b>Deciduous trees:</b></h4>
            <p>It refers to the trees that shed leaves seasonally, and most of the broadleaf trees are deciduous. 
                It has a high rate of photosynthesis because of the shape and the arrangement of the leaf patterns. 
                Shedding leaves prepare them for winter and have good water preservation. Since there is seasonal 
                shedding, these trees are affected by winter weather conditions.</p>
            <p> <b>Examples:</b> Some of the models for deciduous trees are Oak, Maple, and Elm.</p>
            <h4><b>Evergreen Trees:</b></h4>
            <p>These trees are precisely opposite to deciduous trees. 
                The leaves remain on the tree throughout the year, as there is no seasonal shedding. 
                As these trees age, old leaves are replaced with new growth. Many tropical rainforests are 
                considered evergreens as they favor mostly warm, temperate climates.</p>    
            <p><b>Examples: </b> Hemlock, Cycads, and Eucalyptus are some examples of evergreen trees.</p>

            <h4><b><a href=" file:///C:/Users/naika/OneDrive/Desktop/Encyclopedia/basedonseed.html" target="_blank"
                data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-title="Trees based on Seed">2. Based on the seed:</a></b></h4>
            <p>There are two ways you can categorize trees based on grains. They are Angiosperms and Gymnosperms.</p>
            <h4><b>Angiosperms:</b></h4>
            <p>The type of trees that are flowering are often referred to as angiosperms. 
                The seeds of these plants are encased in an ovary, which usually is a fruit. These
                 are typically seasonal plants whose reproductive system resides in flowers and can 
                 be unisexual or bisexual. Angiosperms depend on animals to reproduce.</p>
            <p><b>Examples:</b> Apple, mango, guava are some examples of angiosperms.</p>
            <h4><b>Gymnosperms:</b></h4>
            <p>The trees with no flowers or fruits with exposed seeds that do not have any protection and are found on 
                leaves, scales, or cones. The production of endosperm is done before fertilization and are unisexual. 
                Gymnosperms mostly depend on wind pollination for reproduction and are softwood plants.</p>
            <p><b>Examples:</b> Some of the examples of gymnosperm are Pine, Spruce, and Fur.</p>
