            There are many different types of animals in the world, but some of the largest categories include:

            data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-title="Click to get information about Mammals">Mammals</a></h3>
        <p>The official mammal class is Mammalia. Animals that are considered mammals include warm-blooded vertebrates that have hair or fur and whose babies drink milk. Unlike other animal types like birds and insects, all mammal babies drink milk that comes from their mother’s bodies. This is one of the key ways to know if an animal is a mammal.</p>

            data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-title="Click to get information about Reptiles">Reptiles</a></h3>
        <p>Lizards, dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, and snakes – all belong to that ancient and stout class of animals known as the reptiles. This is a diverse group with more than 10,000 different species and a huge representation in the fossil record. Once the dominant land vertebrates on the planet, reptiles still occupy just about every single ecosystem outside of the extreme north and south.</p>

            data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-title="Click to get information about Fish">Fish</a></h3>
        <p>Fish are aquatic vertebrates. They usually have gills, paired fins, a long body covered with scales, and tend to be cold-blooded. “Fish” is a term used to refer to lampreys, sharks, coelacanths and ray-finned fishes, but is not a taxonomic group, which is a clade or group containing a common ancestor and all its descendants.</p>

        <p>Birds, members of the class Aves, include more than 10,400 living species. Their feathers distinguish them from all other classes of animal; no other animals on earth have them. If you see an animal with feathers, it’s undoubtedly a bird. Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded vertebrates with four-chambered hearts. However, they are more closely related to reptiles and are believed to have evolved from dinosaurs.</p>
